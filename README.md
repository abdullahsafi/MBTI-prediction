# MBTI-prediction
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is used to classify personality types and personality type keys. A Bi-LSTM personality type classification model is created using PyTorch and textual post data collected through the PersonalityCafe forum. The final model is able to predict posts and attempt to classify the author as a Thinker or a Feeler.
